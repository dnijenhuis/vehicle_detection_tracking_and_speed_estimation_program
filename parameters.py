# This module, the parameters module, contains all the parameters that can (and partly must) be configured when a video
# is to be processed.
#
# After importing the necessary modules, the module defines parameters regarding:
# - Paths of relevant files;
# - Speed limits and measuring distances;
# - Locations in the video frames (pixel values) where the measuring starts and ends;
# - The (calculated) minimum number of frames between the start and end to not be speeding;
# - Pre-processing variables;
# - Variables for the detection software;
# - Variables for the tracking software;
# The module ends with logic regarding the drawing of lines and their labels in the output video. These lines do not
# have any technical function in the program but visually demonstrate to the user where the start and end lines are.

distance_in_meters = 60  # ðŸ”§ Set manually for every new setup. Distance between start and end lines (in meters).

# determine the size of the buffer zone in which starting and ending vehicles are to be detected.

# Now for the logic: (distance_in_meters / speed_limit_in_meters_per_second) results in the minimum number of seconds
# that the vehicle should need to get from start to end. This is then multiplied by FPS to convert from seconds to FPS.
# I originally considered rounding the minimum_allowed_number_of_frames_for_distance down but this is not necessary
# since the number of measured frames will always be an integer, so the driver will either drive more or less than,
# for example, 67.5 frames.

# Assuming a distance of 50 meters, this should take at least 2.25 second.
